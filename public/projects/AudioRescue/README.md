- **MacBook Air** (2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024)  
- **iMac** (2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024)
- **Mac Studio** (2022, 2023, 2024)
- **Mac Mini** (2018, 2020, 2023)

### Processor Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Apple Silicon**: M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, M2 Ultra  
- ‚úÖ **Apple Silicon**: M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max
- ‚úÖ **Apple Silicon**: M4, M4 Pro, M4 Max
- ‚úÖ **Intel**: All Intel-based Macs (2016-2020)

Thousands of Mac users worldwide experience these frustrating audio issues that Apple has yet to fully resolve.

### üéµ Audio Problems You're Experiencing
- **Audio crackling and popping** during video calls (Zoom, Teams, FaceTime)
- **Sound stuttering** when using multiple Bluetooth devices (AirPods, speakers, keyboards)
- **Audio distortion** during music playback (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube)
- **Sound cutting out** during CPU-intensive tasks (video editing, gaming, coding)
- **Choppy audio** in streaming services (Netflix, YouTube, Twitch)
- **Audio glitches** during screen recording or presentations
- **Static and buzzing** from internal speakers
- **Microphone crackling** during recordings
- **Audio delay** and sync issues
- **Complete audio failure** requiring restart

### üîç Root Causes (Technical Analysis)
Extensive community research has identified multiple factors:

**Primary Causes:**
- **Memory Pressure**: Audio issues worsen with high RAM usage (>70%)
- **Apple Silicon Load**: M1/M2/M3/M4 processors under heavy load trigger audio problems  
- **CoreAudio Daemon Crashes**: The macOS audio system (coreaudiod) becomes unstable
- **Bluetooth Interference**: Multiple connected devices overwhelm the audio stack
- **Thermal Throttling**: Overheating Macs experience more frequent audio issues

**Secondary Factors:**
- **Background App Conflicts**: Certain apps interfere with CoreAudio
- **macOS Version Bugs**: Specific macOS updates introduce audio regression
- **Hardware Buffer Issues**: Audio buffer overflow in Apple Silicon architecture
- **Power Management**: Battery optimization affects audio processing priority

## üí° The Solution: CoreAudio Reset

### Why This Works
The **CoreAudio daemon (coreaudiod)** is macOS's central audio processing service. When it becomes unstable or crashes, it causes all the audio problems mentioned above. Restarting this service immediately resolves:
- Audio crackling and stuttering
- Bluetooth audio issues  
- Microphone problems
- Audio sync issues
- Complete audio failures

### Manual Fix (Traditional Method)
```bash
sudo killall coreaudiod
```
